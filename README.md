# PlantMama
This site was created for a Codecademy project. I created the logo, came up with a color scheme, and found all the photos on Unsplash then went ahead and coded the site. It was a lot of fun for me! It's my first full project like this and I'm pretty proud with the result though there are definitely quite a few things I might have changed (if I knew how).

Thank you for checking it out!
The Logo I made (and all it's variations):
